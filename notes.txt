DO NOT START WRITING CODE BEFORE WALKING THROUGH THE APPROACH AND CHECKING IF IT WORKS .
TEST THE CODE MANUALLY BEFORE RUNNING A TEST CASE IN ECLIPSE.
DO NOT BE IN A HURRY IN ANY STEP.

1. Rotate Array. Try to do in o[n] memory and o[1] space. Could not achieve it.
2. 

CHAPTER 6
1. Got this solution after copying. Do this again. (p1)
2. Got this solution after debugging. Did not check the limits inside while loop. Do this again. (p2)
3. 

CHAPTER4:

1. 
2. 
3. 
4. Try to implement this using two Queues.(p2)
4_1. Got this idea after completing the Q4. REMEMBER to use TWO QUEUES for this. p2
5. For validating BST, we need to validate limits of each node.Just checking its limits with immediate parent or child nodes is not sufficient.
17.Got idea from book and looking online. p2. Wrote Search and prefix, did not write insert . Wrote insert later.
18.

CHAPTER3:
2. Got idea after looking online. Made mistake . Had to debug and find out. p1.
3. Made a mistke p2.Got idea since i did cloning a graph in interview of walmart

A stable sort is one which preserves the original order of input set , where comparison algorithm 
does not distiinguish between two or more sets.
Implement a HEAP datastructure P1 (heap Sort)

7_1. Do again. No idea what i did.
9. Got this idea after reading online. p1
11. Remove all linked list elements having a particular value . P1 . HAVE A HELPER NODE AS HEAD.

Done with this chapter. Better to redo once later.

45. DO THIS AGAIN.REMEMBER.
Got idea from online. Fairly simple problem if i can get idea of how to solve.

CHAPTER 7:
3. Required to be done again . P2
